# RhinoChess

---

A deep learning chess engine with PyTorch

**Rhino** is a deep learning chess engine largely inspired by the [DeepChess](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/papers/deepchess.pdf) paper released in 2016. A CNN has been added among other modifications to optimize learning. The notebook is set up to walk you through most of the high level details.

The Colab is viewable [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1V8KEI0qYJiqSAjN2vUTdpTHvw1pkrZB0?usp=sharing)

I wrote an [article](https://owensmith.page/building-a-deep-learning-chess-engine/) covering some details in the preprocessing/model-architecture stages

Enjoy!
